My main skills are:

- Game design 🎲
- Communication 🗣
- Balancing ⚖
- Programming
- 

Here is a sample of what I love about game development:

- juggling with constrains 🤹‍♂️
- sharing obscure but insightful games 🐴
- prototyping mechanics ❓
- confront a vision to reality 👓
- I'm overusing emojis 🚯

Beside making games I'm also:

- Making mods for existing games 👨‍🔧
- code tools and small softwares 🧰
- Teaching game development to kids 🧒

### my history

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29) and it will answer **all** your questions.
