    RESHDP is a set of HD texture packs for the classic Resident Evil games using Machine-learning techniques and made by a team of 4 persons. These packs are notable for avoiding the seams which appear on the backgrounds when the textures are being filtered.

    As a programmer, I developed the custom techniques to solve the seam issue and the tools used to recreate properly the game textures from HD ones.
    I also modified Dolphin, an excellent Gamecube emulator, to ensure the best experience possible.

    While the RE2 pack was noted (and appreciated) by the RE community, the RE3 one got a massive amount of attention (for a game mod) from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=resident+evil+seamless&sp=CAM%253D">content creators</a> and <a data-toggle="modal" href="#reshdp-articles">the gaming press</a>. RE2 Remake's success and its inevitable follow-up were certainly to be thanked for that.
