    Might and Magic: Duel of Champions is CCG set in the Might and Magic universe developed by <strong>Ubisoft
        Quebec</strong>.

<p>
    It used an original combat system that put the focus on heroes, creature positioning and random events. 
    Heroes have their own abilities and their stats can be improved during a match.

    As Line designer working from Ubisoft HQ, I mostly supported the core team on various design aspects. I later joined Ubisoft Chengdu and worked on the Chinese version of the game as a Game Designer. Definitely one of my favourite projects at Ubisoft.
